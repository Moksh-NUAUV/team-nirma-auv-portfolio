## 🔍 Project Highlights

### 1. [ROS2 stack in python](projects/barcode-vision-system/overview.md)
> Communication and networking between the processor and the controller using ros2 humble.

### 2. [Localisation using Ping Echosounders](projects/barcode-vision-system/overview.md)
> Two 1d-ping-echo sounders were used to calculate and localise the coordinates in the pool environment.

### 3. [Embedded Programming](projects/barcode-vision-system/overview.md)
> Wrote the teensy 4.1 code for sensor integration and manoeuvring.

### 4. [Stability Algorithm](projects/barcode-vision-system/overview.md)
> Tuned the PID constants for optimum stability underwater.
 
### 5. [Barcode Vision Mapping System](projects/barcode-vision-system/overview.md)
> Real-time barcode localization for underwater autonomous navigation using OpenCV and ROS.

### 6. [Joystick Teleoperation System](projects/joystick-teleop-control/overview.md)
> Manual override system using ROS Joy and custom teleop nodes for mission safety.

### 7. [IMU + Depth GUI](projects/imu-depth-gui/overview.md)
> A PyQt GUI showing live IMU and pressure sensor data along with camera feed using ROS and OpenCV.
